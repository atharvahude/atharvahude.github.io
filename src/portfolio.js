  introduction: "I‚Äôve always been fascinated by the way machines perceive the world. Growing up, I was the kind of person who would take things apart just to understand how they worked‚Äîonly to put them back together in a way that made them better. That curiosity led me into the world of artificial intelligence and robotics, where I‚Äôve spent years exploring how we can make machines not just smarter, but also more intuitive and explainable. My journey has taken me from late-night coding sessions to securing research contracts that push AI beyond black-box solutions. Whether it‚Äôs building autonomous systems that respond to natural language or optimizing machine learning models to run efficiently on the edge, I thrive on challenges that merge intelligence with real-world application. At the core of it all, I believe technology should be more than just powerful‚Äîit should be understandable, adaptable, and built for impact.",
